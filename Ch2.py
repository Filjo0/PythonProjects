Chapter 2.
3. Five Star Retro Video rents VHS tapes and DVDs to the same connoisseurs who
like to buy LP record albums. The store rents new videos for $3.00 a night, and
oldies for $2.00 a night. Write a program that the clerks at Five Star Retro Video
can use to calculate the total charge for a customerâ€™s video rentals. The program
should prompt the user for the number of each type of video and output the total
cost.
